      "text": "It is 10 p.m. on the East Coast. This is CNN Tonight. I'm Don Lemon. A community are mourning tonight in Virginia were two young journalists were executed on live TV this morning, 6:45 a.m., reporter Allison Parker and cameraman Adam Ward in the middle of the kind of live shot that reporters all across this country do every day.  With no reason to suspect the slightest hint of danger. They don't even notice the gunman as he approaches them. Shots rang out. Ward falls. His camera capturing this image of the shooter, Vester Lee Flanagan, former TV reporter known on the air as Bryce Williams.  The woman being interviewed, Vicki Gardener is shot in the back and in stable condition tonight. Parker tries to run away screaming but he shot dead. The gunman flees, but fatally shoots himself a few hours later when he is cornered by police.  My colleague, Chris Cuomo is leading our coverage tonight from Virginia, and he joins us now with the very latest. Chris, what do you have?"

      "text": "I'll tell you, Don. It's hard to think if whether going through Adam Ward's mind was to try to get this on camera in the middle of all that hard. That image obviously was key, early on for investigators.  This live shot was just about the 50th anniversary of a reservoir and a recreation area. It was not a foreseeable or risky situation. This madman that decided to turn his rage against a former employer, he hadn't sent the kinds of threats that would flag any of this. We haven't heard anything from his family that indicated a struggle that they were aware of then.  Yet, his digital footprint now gives a gross and expanding idea of his madness, of the rage of how he directed it and tried to say it was about racism and what was done to him and victimization. He'd been dismissed from two different news stations because of personality and behavior problems.  And then, he did this. He says it's about the Charleston massacre. He did by two handguns. At that time we know that and we believe that authorities think one of those was used this morning. However, his motivations are no justification for the madness. And  what we know for sure is that two young lives were lost, 24-year-old Allison Parker remembered by her colleagues and those who know her as the essential spirit of what journalism is. The passion and purpose that made her so special at such a young age, and 27-year-old, Adam Ward. They were like a team.  He was engaged. His fiancee, the love of his life was in the control room this morning and had to see what that madman did to end their lives. And now, their families are mourning for him. This is over. He's dead. For their families and loved ones in this news station, this is just the beginning. And so, go the questions, Don. Why did this happen? How do you prevent to the next time? How do we heal?  Let's bring in someone who has perspective on this state and these problems. Jim Gilmore, former governor of Virginia, republican presidential candidate.  Governor, I've talked to you before. I'm sorry, it's under these circumstances right now. My question to you is an obvious one. What do we do after a situation like this? We see them repeated around the country, different families; different communities are bearing the scars of the same types of senseless violence. What do we do?"

And you really have to focus on the loss for the families for the friends who have come forward and express this loss and you can't go back. Once the person is gone, they're gone. And it's a terrible loss and a terrible tragedy.  But we're not going to let this madman take away the lawful rights of Americans to keep and bear arms. We're going to stand up for the Second Amendment. But the answer to your question is that the time has come to turn our attention to mental health.  We're seeing these kinds of situations occur across the United States. And in fact, we're seeing the \n were wide now and reported. And we're just not really focusing on the danger that people cause when they have this kind of mental instability.  Something has to be done about that. We can't divert attention away from this \n the solving of the problem by turning our attention to mental health issues by trying to go into gun control issues, the way some politicians have today. I think that diverts us from the real solution."

There is a debate about gun control that oddly does not change in this country no matter what happens.  You look at a man like this. He had every legal right to get these two handguns. They didn't know his motivation for getting and no background check that we have currently would have changed that. But does it make \n does it make you think?

You can't predict whether a person is going to use a knife or a gun or some other kind of instrumentality.  We have a report from two days ago of a young man in Oklahoma who killed his father in a coffee shop with a knife. So, that's not the issue. The gun is not the issue. The knife is not the issue. The issue is that family members, community leaders, people who are out there working with people need to be in a position to learn about what we can do regarding mental health to report dangerous people, to get them some treatment and under some supervision so that they don't go off and do some tragedy like this which is irreversible. And I think the tragedy is just awful."

We don't know that it's present here by diagnosis. You can be evil. You can be bad and not be ill. And as you know, the mentally ill are less likely to be violent than the rest of society. They are more likely to be victims than they are assailants. And yet, we have representative, Tim Murphy and who he has co-sponsors on a bill to help families get help for people who don't want to get it for themselves or can't handle their own treatment.

If I become the President of the United States I'm going to do what I did as governor and really focus a lot of attention on mental health issues, particularly community mental health issue. I refuse to participate in the taking away of lawful rights under the Second Amendment for Americans to keep and bear arms.  The politicians were wrong today to go out there and begin the same old song about gun control when that is not the issue. It's infuriating because it's diverting us away from what we can do to begin to solve this problem. And that is to identify people who are unstable.  The record was this fellow was unstable. He had to be escorted out when he was discharged from his job. He's going to have people who know him, family members who know him, and others like this.  And we have an obligation as a community, to really speak up and point out when a person needs help and when they're dangerous to the community and to the peace of society around them. That is a direction we have to go, Chris. And this whole talk about gun control is diverting us away from where we need to be."

Are we doing it because we're concerned about people who are suffering from mental health issues? Or are we doing it because we're concerned about the people they might shoot.

But probably didn't have the tools to deal with it and were reluctant to even talk about it.  And so, you know, one of the issues I think \n I think gun control and mental health issues are sort of combined in this kind of case and you even have Allison Parker's father saying we've got to do something in this country about getting the guns out of the hands of crazy people."
