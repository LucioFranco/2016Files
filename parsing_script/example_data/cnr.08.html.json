      "text": "Back here on CNN breaking news. I'm Brooke Baldwin.   We've been covering the tragic deaths of two young journalists in Roanoke, Virginia, this morning shot and killed by a former employee of this TV station.  It's our CNN affiliate WDBJ.  This happened on live television.  It happened right around 6:45 this morning.  We've now heard from the sheriff in Franklin County confirming that the gunman is dead after ultimately shooting himself during this police pursuit.   We're also learning a lot more about the two young journalists, 24- year-old Alison Parker and 27-year-old Adam Ward.  Both starting their careers.  Adam was a photojournalist who attended Virginia Tech.  He was 27.  Alison Parker was just 24.  She gone to James Madison University.  She was working at this TV station as a reporter.  They were a team each and every morning.  And so hours after the \n the shootings the general manager of the TV station came on air to express really what these two young people meant to the station, to the community and just absolute heartbreak in this newsroom."

They were loved.  They were positive people. They never shied away from an assignment.  If you asked them to work late, they did it.  If you \n you didn't even have to ask them.  And you're never prepared for this, and you just pray every day that your people are going to be safe.  And we are grateful to the families of these two victims who gave them to us so that they could do their job and do the job so well to make WDBJ 7 so strong.  And our hearts go out to them as it does, I'm sure, from every one of our shoes and from those at WDBJ 7."

He's Larell Reynolds.  He joins me now.   And Larell, just first to you, I'm so sorry for what happened.  I was a cover reporter in Charles, Virginia.  I know what it's like to get that first job in TV and had that special relationship with your co- workers.  So I'm so, so sorry for you, first and foremost.  How did you learn about this?"

And as you're, you know, remembering these two people, the superstar intern and this, you know, funny cameraman and it is just based upon all their smiles and they are in the pictures together, it makes my heart smile to see how much that you can tell they love their job.   And so, there they were this morning, you know, covering this tourism bouncing back at this one place in the Roanoke area, and they were murdered on live television.  And the man who was holding the gun was someone who worked at the TV station before, and you know him as well."

And, you know, he's very aggressive towards people.  He couldn't take criticism, and he took it personally.  And at the station he was let go and threw a huge tantrum that caused a lot of our co-workers to fear our own safety.  There were \n like we were in a lockdown the day that he was fired.  And a few days later we had like police detail that kind of watched over the station because we didn't know the extent of I guess his mental illness."

And the aftermath of the tantrum was there use newsroom desk, like computer monitors and things thrown on the ground.

Was this a name that people still sort of remember him and were worried about him or was his presence long gone?"

    {
      "speaker": "REYNOLDS",
      "text": "Well, I left probably a few months after he was fired.  So I don't have any perspective of how his name is still on the newsroom. What I do know is he filed a lawsuit against the company and that lawsuit this year did not succeed in his favor.  So I don't know if that's pent up aggression from the lawsuit.  He felt that his firing was racially motivated."

But he sent this fax up here to ABC News and apparently part of the fax in addition to calling himself a powder keg whoa was one day going to go boom, just quoting him, he also apparently said he was motivated by that church shooting just a couple of months ago in Charleston, South Carolina, which was racially motivated.  And so, he was apparently infuriated by that.  And a couple days later that's when he bought the gun.  What did he ever talk to you about anything race-related while you two were at the station?"

And he insinuated like that the black people in the company needs to watch out for each other.  So he always had that racial awareness and the company even though it didn't exist to my knowledge, to my experience of how the company was."

What will you miss most about these two?"

So our condolences, of course, with the newsroom family in Roanoke, Virginia and their own families.   We're also learning a bit more about the shooter who is now dead, died because of his own self-inflicted gunshot wound just about two hours ago.   So let me if to our investigative correspondent Drew Griffin who has been looking into the shooter's past.  And specifically, we know he's worked at a couple of different local stations, Drew, and there was a lawsuit that he filed some years ago tell me about that."

That seems to be the case as well when he worked in Tallahassee, Florida, as a reporter.  He worked there one year before he was fired there in the year 2000.  The news director, the then news director, said he was fired because of very odd behavior.  And the shooting suspect filed a lawsuit claiming racial discrimination.  In the suit he claimed that a producer claimed him a, quote, \"monkey\" and other allegations of racism were made in that lawsuit that, quote, \"black people are lazy.\" One of his co-workers told him according to that lawsuit.  It was settled out of court.  We don't know the disposition of it, but there seems to be a history everywhere this person has worked where he's been a very difficult employee to work with and very difficult to his employers as well."

OK.  Drew Griffin, thank you so much.   On the other side of the break we're going to talk to Brian Stelter just about how he would have known where this crew was located in Roanoke to even commit such heinous crimes.  So we'll talk about that in just a second.   Quick break.  We are back after this."

We may never fully know.  But one of the questions being asked and it was addressed by the general manager of this TV station, WDBJ is the location of the TV crew this morning?  How would this man, this gunman have known where they were to come and find them and to commit such and atrocities.   Brian Stelter is still with me, our senior media correspondent, host of \"RELIABLE SOURCES.\"  Not to get too inside baseball, but you know, having been a local reporter in four different TV affiliates before coming to CNN, you know, and having work the morning shift, you just sort get that assignment.  Sometimes, you know, ahead of time, sometimes, you know, but at the end of the day, they had a live hit before he showed up."

      "text": "That's right.  I was actually just watching the live shots that they were doing earlier in the morning, 5:45, 6:15.  So, it was pretty obvious to viewers where the crew was that morning, what they are going to be doing that morning.  They were going to be covering this lake and the chamber of commerce event all morning long, so it would be obvious to any viewers how to go and see them.  And in this case, perhaps, the gunman.   That said, we do have a sense of methodical  planning here.  We have heard about the rental car a month ahead of time.  You see the twitter account set up a week ahead of time.  Perhaps he had targeted them long before this morning, but it is obvious, you know, people were able to see on television where they were, and it's heartbreaking to watch their report.   You know, morning TV is a special time of day, by the way.  People are just waking up, they are turning on the TV for companionship, to find out what happened overnight, and you feel a real connection to the people that are on in the morning when you're watching at home.  So to the viewers in this local community, I've been reading their comments on Facebook, so many of them are in true shock about losing someone they considered a friend."

Let me show you something, as we talked so much about the Dow this week, look at the green, 619 points in positive territory, eight minutes left to go of the trading day.  That's some good news for us on this Wednesday.  We'll be right back.     Well, it was just Monday morning remember when the Dow Jones industrial opened negative a thousand points, my goodness what three days could do for you, up 622 points.  Couple of minutes left to the trading day, folks.  It is on track to be the biggest daily point gain since we've seen since 2008.  We'll be we watching the closing beg to see where those numbers stand for.   Meantime, let's sneak in some politics here because it is significant. We ahead from Hillary Clinton, as we have been talking about. Remember, she addressed the tragedy in Roanoke, Virginia from earlier this morning.  She is also taking some questions from reporters.  You know, she ended her vacation early to hit the trail, get back on the trail, and all of this in the background.  There have been rumors now persisting that the vice president Joe Biden may be jumping into this race.   CNN's senior Washington correspondent Joe Johns is there traveling along with Hillary Clinton, with press corps there in Iowa.   Joe Johns, I know you got a question in about a potential Biden run. How did Hillary Clinton respond to that?"

I worked with him obviously in President Obama's first term.  And I have a great deal of admiration and affects to him.  And I think he has to make what is a very difficult decision for himself and his family."

Listen, you've been covering Washington for a long, long time.  You know, really this is somebody who has wanted to be the president of the United States since the late '80s.  This would be his third go-around as he throw his hat on the ring.  We know that he met with Senator Elizabeth Warren over the weekend at his home at the naval observatory.  How much longer do you think he really has to decide?"

He doesn't have that much time because as you know, Hillary Clinton has a very well put together organization here in Iowa and in other places.  She also has a lot of donors, a lot of fund-raisers, and people are working hard for her.  So his problem is getting enough people to put together a viable organization in a very short time, if he decides to do that, Brooke."
